A **Hero** begins his journey in the land,
    his *name* is _wordly_, as I understand,
    at the unknown *age*, but _countable_,

"A *mouse* begins his journey in the land,
        A *spouse* begins his journey in the land,
        A ***divided*** begins his journey in the land,
        A *divided* begins his journey in the land"
